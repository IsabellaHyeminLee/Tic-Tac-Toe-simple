extra(how to change your file and commit it)
- if you change your file which place in the folder gitkraken 
show you there is a change on the top of the line
- then go to command line and 'git status' 
- you will see your file color has changed as red also it's written 
as modified.   

- go back to the gitkraken and click //wip
- that will show you unstaged files 
- you can visually click the file and trans to staged file

- and now if you go back to the command line and type 'git status'
- you will see your file color has changed as green. still in modified

-to commit it you can use commit message in gitkraken after enter your commit message

- if you type 'git status' on the command line 
- you will see 'nothing to commit, working tree clean'

extra2(how to go back to your previous file(travel back in time)
- when you click a commit message in gitkraken 
- you will see 'commit: e21123(random)' on the right side that lets you 
  go back to the other version of files in command line
- so copy the commit and go to command line and type 
'git checkout (and paste(right click on your mouse) what you copied)'
- if you check on your file you will see your file came back to how it was
- come back to gitkraken and you can see there is 'HEAD' and that means
where we are currently at
- now we are not in the most updated version
- if you do 'git log' on your command line you can see what happened
- if you enter 'git checkout master' that should take you to the master commit
that means it will take you forward in time
- and you will see you sure are in gitkraken also in the file

- you should put the file in the same folder and follow 3->4->5
- you will see the update of your file in the folder in gitkraken
